### Sir Grabsalot ###
This little java-based application scans your musical collection and extends it with useful information: missing album art, missing/incorrect tagging information, artist pictures and lyrics. Currently it only supports last.fm as information service and only supports music libraries with the library/artist/album/track.ext folder structure. It also has basic playback support.
